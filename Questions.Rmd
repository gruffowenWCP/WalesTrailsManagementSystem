1. I'd like to be able to pipe straight from select into filter, so I can select relevant variables and then ditch some redundant rows in one go, but I keep getting errors. Grr! 

Example code:

```{r}
Issues <- 
  read.csv("Z:/Access Recreation & Education/Access & Recreation Programmes & Projs/Wales Coast Path & National Trails/WTMS - Annual Results/WCP - 2020 - 2021/Conwy/Issues_Conwy_2020-10-09.csv") %>% 

  select( 
    Code = IssueCode,
    PromotedRoute,
    ManagingAuth,
    Region,
    IssueType,
    IssueTypeGroup,
    StatusDesc,
    PriorityDesc,
    Complete,
    Firm,
    ProtrusionFree,
    SafelySited,
    HandpostPresent,
    StepsInPlace,
    SwingFreely,
    LatchesAndBolts,
    HorseLatch,
    BackpackNegotiable,
    LogoPresent,
    OrientedCorrectly,
    ClearlyVisible,
    Bilingual,
    RouteName,
    Action,
    DateLastUpdated,
    PromotedRoute
  ) %>% 
  filter(Issues, StatusDesc != "HistoricRedundant")
```


2. In the "Apply Grouping Variables" section, I'm not sure whether the many to one join method is the best way to do it?
